### Personally, I have always been fascinated with the world of technology ever since I first came in contact with it. Just like any other individual, I have planned and pushed through those plans to achieve my life goals. I am excited to become a part of Pursuit fellows. Eagerly look forward to learning new skills and techniques to become a software developer.
