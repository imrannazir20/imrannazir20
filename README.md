### I am a Full Stack Software Development Fellow at Pursuit who has been fascinated with technology since building my first website. I was among a selective cohort of applicants to be invited into Pursuit's Fellowship for rising developers and have already mastered JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, Express, React/Redux, PostgreSQL, APIs, Git, Data Structures, Algorithms, sprints, Agile, code reviews, and pair programming. My greatest key strengths include as a problem solver, an interest in learning new things, and reliable. I have the ability to see a situation from different perspectives and I can get my work done even in the face of difficult obstacles.
I want to develop a custom medical software that will give unique solutions to doctors and patents for a specific medical facility.
I really enjoy cooking in my spare time. I often watch cooking programs to learn new cooking techniques and learn about new dishes. I am a big fan of cricket. Sometimes I play cricket with friends .
